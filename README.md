# WheelYo! Game

## How to Play

This is a press your luck style game where the goal is to see how high of a score you can get.  You gain points by spinning the wheel and landing on wedges with a positive outcome. Initially the entire wheel is filled with positive outcomes.  However, everytime you land on a wedge with a positive outcome you must replace that wedge with a new wedge which will have a negative outcome.  The wheel becomes unfriendlier as the game goes on!  You continue playing until you have a negative 'At Risk' balance, hit a 'GAME OVER', or decide to quit with your current total.
